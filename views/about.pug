  h1 About Grade Your Professor
  //- .col-md-8
  .ex1  This is an online platform for the student community of IIT Kanpur where students can give feedback on professors by rating them over a few questions. Having professor reviews beforehand is very crucial in designing semester templates which otherwise remains chaotic. Students can use this platform to know about the public-view performance of professors and hence decide on whether to take courses with him or not. We would like to emphasize that any professor rating only symbolizes the professorâ€™s teachings.
